        <p><h3>Syrupy, Sugary, Buttery</h3></p>
        <p>Thrown together with a few staple items in the kitchen, 
           french toast is a delicious meal for any time of the day.
           I use gluten-free bread when I make it (usually Udi brand,
           or from my local bakery), but you can use whatever bread
           is best for you. When I ate wheat, my favorite was a cheap
           loaf of thick Texas-toast style white bread.</p>
