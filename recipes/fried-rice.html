        <h3>Sweet, Spicy, Salty</h3>
        <p>I'm gluten-intolerant, so rice is a staple carb at my house.
           There are a lot of ways to dress the grain up, but the best
           I've found is a simple Thai(ish)-style fried recipe. The ingredients 
           I use come from convenience. I usually have just enough of 
           each ingredient to pull the dish together. Infused with fish 
           sauce, soy sauce, heat, sugar, and spice-- it's by far my 
           favorite dish. What do you think?
