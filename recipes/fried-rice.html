        <p><h3>Thai-ish Fried Rice: Like Takeout!</h3></p>
        <p>Unlike Chinese fried rice, Thai fried rice uses jasmine rice as a base. I like Thai food, so I try</p>
        <p>and emulate that. Infused with fish sauce, a unique blend of spices, and garnished with fresh scallions,</p>
        <p>it's my favorite food. And I'm pretty sure my recipe isn't horrible, but what do you think?</p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients I Guessed At</h3></p>
